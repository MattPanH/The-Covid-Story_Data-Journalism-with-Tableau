The client is an international public health agency. I was tasked to produce a piece of data journalism on, “Where is the coronavirus situation the worst?” and summarize my findings in an interactive dashboard and presentation aimed at board members of the public health agency.

The following questions were considered in my data analysis:
<br/>1) How can I quantify ‘worst’ and what are the pros and cons of my choice?
<br/>2) What level of geography am I looking at, and what are the limitations associated with it?
<br/>3) What is the timeframe I am interested in?
<br/>4) Do the countries which have been most affected by coronavirus share any characteristics in common?
<br/>5) What is the impact of vaccines in countries?
<br/>6) What are the limitations of the dataset?

The data originally comes from Our World in Data (OWID) and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
